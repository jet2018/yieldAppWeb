# YieldUp

YieldUp is a web and mobile application that can be used by farmers to detect crop diseases mainly in cassava, beans, and coffee by taking pictures of plant leaves.

YieldUp is built with a computer vision model that is able to do image processing and be able to diagnose crop disease. For now the system is
limited to cassava and beans which are common food crops grown in Africa and mostly consumed by people of Africa.
